            <h2>Our Coffee Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                At Coffee Haven, we’re more than just a café – we’re a lifestyle. 
                Handcrafted from sustainably sourced beans, every cup is brewed with precision, love, and an understanding of the slow coffee culture. We believe in 
                minimalism, sustainability, and making time for what matters: savoring every sip of an exceptional coffee experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a nod to the golden age of espresso and a commitment to modern-day ethics, we roast our beans locally, ensuring fresh flavors and reducing our environmental footprint. 
                This is the place where design meets comfort, and where coffee tells a story.
